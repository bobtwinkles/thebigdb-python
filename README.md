===============

Sorry, I'm not a native python developer, and haven't yet had the time to learn enough about it to make a decent wrapper for [TheBigDB](http://thebigdb.com);  

If you feel like landing a hand, **please do** ! Just fork this project and submit a pull request, and I'll take a look at it very quickly.
You can take your inspiration on what the functionalities should be in the [Ruby](https://github.com/thebigdb/thebigdb-ruby) and the [Javascript](https://github.com/thebigdb/thebigdb-js) wrappers.

Thanks !
Love you guys!
